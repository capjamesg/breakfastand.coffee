== Facts About Lowdown ==

* Offers retail coffee on a shelf right next to their ordering counter.
* Is a relatively small coffee shop so probably not the ideal place to work for the day if you're a remote worker.
* The coffee preparation area is in the main room and is not behind a bar. This means you can see everything going on when coffee is made from most of the indoor seats.
