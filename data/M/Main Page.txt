== Why ==

Finding recommendations for new breakfast and coffee stops in a city or area can be difficult, especially if you know only a few people from the place you are visiting.

Breakfast and Coffee aggregates recommendations and information about eateries so you can find places to visit when you're visitng an area.

Breakfast and Coffee aims to highlight exemplerary establishments, with reference to factors that matter when you're making a choice about where to eat or drink in a city. This is not a community to share negative experiences about eateries or coffee houses.
